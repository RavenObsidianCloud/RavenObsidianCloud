# 🦅 Raven Obsidian Cloud

> "Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure." - Rowena Ravenclaw

**Chad Dutcher** | Ravenclaw 💙 | Healthcare IT → Cloud Engineering

## 🎯 Currently

- 📚 Preparing for **Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer** (April 2026)
- 🧪 Completed **60+ hands-on GCP labs**
- 🏥 Working full-time as IT Help Desk Technician @ Sante Health System
- 🦅 Learning in public (because that's what Ravenclaws do)

## 💙 The Ravenclaw Approach

I don't just memorize commands - I build understanding:
- 📖 Creating mental models (like my "Skyscraper of GCP" Inprogress)
- 🔍 Testing everything hands-on (kentintic learning)
- 📝 Documenting the journey
- 🤝 Sharing what I learn

**Current Focus:**
- Compute Engine & VM management
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Cloud Storage & lifecycle policies
- VPC networking & firewalls
- IAM roles & service accounts
- Database Optimization: Implementing granular scaling in Cloud Spanner using Processing Units (PUs) instead of full nodes to optimize costs.

## 💰 FinOps & Cost Optimization
I prioritize building cost-effective infrastructure. A key example is my approach to **Google Cloud Spanner**:

- **Granular Scaling:** By using `100 --processing-units` (PUs) instead of `1 --node`, I can deploy an instance at **10% of the cost**.
- **The Math:** $100 \text{ PUs} = 0.1 \text{ nodes}$. 
- **Efficiency:** This reduces the entry cost from ~$650/mo to ~$65/mo while retaining the same $1024$ GB storage limit—perfect for lean development and scaling.

## 🏰 Why "RavenObsidianCloud"?

🦅 **Raven** - Proud Ravenclaw (intelligence, wisdom, learning)  
🖤 **Obsidian** - Formed under intense pressure (full-time work + cert prep)  
☁️ **Cloud** - My domain, my future

Yes, I took the Sorting Hat quiz seriously. And yes, that attention to detail makes me a better engineer.

## 📊 Journey Progress

- ✅ 60+ GCP hands-on labs completed
- ✅ IAM & BigQuery skill badges earned
- ✅ Chapters 4-8 of Official Study Guide
- 🔄 Building real infrastructure daily
- 🎯 Exam: April 2026 (or earlier 😉)

## 🎮 After Hours

When I'm not in the cloud or studying, you'll find me gaming as **DjGuckie** 🎮
